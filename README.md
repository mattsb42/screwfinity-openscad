I recently discovered the phenomenal
[Screwfinity Unit by ZombieHedgehog](https://thangs.com/designer/ZombieHedgehog/3d-model/Screwfinity%20Unit%202U%20Medium%20-%20The%20Gridfinity%20Storage%20Unit-1027305),
and have loved it for starting to organize
my small screws and similar items.
I've been pretty happy with it as-is,
but when I found the
[4U wide variant by Myrmecodia](https://thangs.com/designer/Myrmecodia/3d-model/Screwfinity%20Medium%20Wide%204U%20drawer%20set-1097859),
I realized what was missing. :)

While both of these projects are great,
every new variant,
be that drawer height or depth,
or different drawer cabinets,
needed manual attention to generate and mutate.
It was also kind of annoying to have to print and glue
the [inserts](https://thangs.com/designer/Fresh%20Brewed%20Design/3d-model/Screwfinity%20Grid%20Insert-1052789)
for the drawer cabinet tops,
which very reasonable are not included by default.

I'd also been looking for a good project to learn [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/).

The goal of this project is to have fully parameterized drawers and cabinets,
with the option to enable or disable
cabinet-top grids,
drawer labels,
and other features as I find them.
