# Screwfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD

Drawing inspiration (and modules) from
[Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad),
this is a port of
[Screwfinity Unit by ZombieHedgehog](https://thangs.com/designer/ZombieHedgehog/3d-model/Screwfinity%20Unit%202U%20Medium%20-%20The%20Gridfinity%20Storage%20Unit-1027305)
in OpenSCAD.

The deeper I got into Screwfinity,
the more I found edge cases where the existing set of models
didn't _quite_ meet what I wanted,
or just took a lot of ground-up work to make new variants.
I had been looking for a project to use to learn OpenSCAD,
and this seemed like something that would be perfect for
algorithmic definition.

My goal is for this project to be fully compatible with the original Screwfinity models,
as well as offering several additional features that the original does not offer,
such as heterogeneous cabinets and alternative mounting options.

See [docs](./docs/) and [examples](./examples/) for usage instructions.
