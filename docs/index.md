# Getting Started

If you want to use this project directly,
you'll need to check out the repo,
including submodules,
and [install OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html).

Once you have a working environment,
see [drawers](./drawers.md) and [cabinets](./cabinets.md)
for detailed information on how to make components.

# Releases

If you don't want to have to generate files directly,
I [plan](https://github.com/mattsb42/screwfinity-rebuilt-openscad/issues/12)
to start publishing
a set of common cabinet and drawer
sizes and configurations,
and attaching them to
[GitHub releases](https://github.com/mattsb42/screwfinity-rebuilt-openscad/releases).
Check there for pre-made models,
and if you have a common configuration that you want,
feel free to open an issue and ask to add it to the build.
